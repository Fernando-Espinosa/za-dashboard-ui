# ZA Dashboard UI - Design Documentation

## Design Process

### Architecture

- **Component-Based Structure:** The application follows a modular architecture with well-defined components organized in a hierarchy:
  - `MasterView`: Core layout wrapper with navigation drawer
  - `DashboardView`: Main dashboard content container
  - `PatientSummaryCard`: Data aggregation and filtering UI
  - `PatientDashboardTable`: Real-time patient data display

### State Management

- **React Query**: Used for server state management and data fetching
  - Implements caching with configurable stale times
  - Handles loading states efficiently
- **React Hooks**: Used for local component state
  - `useState` for UI state (filters, pagination, drawer open/close)
  - `useCallback` and `useMemo` for performance optimization
  - Custom hooks to encapsulate business logic:
    - `useInitialPatients`: Data fetching and transformation
    - `useEchoWebSocket`: Real-time data simulation with WebSockets

### Component Design

- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each component has a focused purpose
- **Separation of Logic**: Business logic isolated in hooks
- **UI/UX Considerations**:
  - Loading states (skeletons) for improved user experience
  - Visual highlighting for real-time data changes
  - Responsive design using MUI Grid system

### Scalability and Maintainability

- **Clean Code Structure**: Organized in directories by feature/module
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript interfaces and types for all data structures
- **Style Isolation**: Component-specific styles in separate files
- **User-Facing Messages**: Externalized in dedicated message files for easier maintenance
- **State Normalization**: Avoids state duplication for ease of updates

## Choice of Tools and Libraries

### Core Framework

- **React**: Chosen for component-based architecture and efficient rendering
- **TypeScript**: Provides static typing to catch errors early and improve maintainability

### UI Framework

- **Material UI**: Comprehensive component library that accelerates development
  - Consistent theming and styling
  - Built-in responsive design
  - Accessibility features

### State Management

- **React Query**: Modern data-fetching library that simplifies server state
  - Caching and invalidation control
  - Loading/error state management
  - Devtools for debugging

### API Communication

- **Axios**: Robust HTTP client for data fetching
- **WebSocket**: For real-time data updates (simulated in the current implementation)

### Build Tools

- **Vite**: Fast, modern bundler for improved developer experience
  - Quick hot module replacement
  - Efficient production builds

## Scaling Considerations

### Data Management

- **Pagination**: Currently implemented at the client-side for better UX
- **Server-Side Pagination**: Would be implemented for larger datasets
- **Data Virtualization**: For extremely large tables to minimize DOM elements

### Performance Optimization

- **Memoization**: Already using `useMemo` and `useCallback` for expensive operations
- **Code Splitting**: Could implement lazy loading for larger application sections
- **Service Worker**: For caching static assets and improved offline experience

### Infrastructure

- **Load Balancing**: Multiple server instances for handling increased user load
- **CDN Integration**: For static asset delivery
- **Database Optimization**: Implement proper indexing and query optimization

### Real-time Updates

- **WebSocket Connection Pooling**: Manage connection limits for large user bases
- **Selective Updates**: Transmit only changed data to minimize bandwidth

## Future Enhancements

### Feature Additions

- **Advanced Filtering**: More comprehensive filtering options beyond the current implementation
- **Patient Details View**: Drill-down interface for detailed patient information
- **Historical Data Visualization**: Charting of patient vital trends over time
- **Alert System**: Configurable alerts for critical patient conditions
- **User Authentication**: Role-based access control for different staff levels

### Technical Improvements

- **State Management Enhancement**: Consider Redux for more complex state requirements
- **Backend Integration**: Replace mock data with real API endpoints
- **Testing Framework**: Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests
- **Accessibility Improvements**: Enhanced screen reader support and keyboard navigation
- **Internationalization**: Support for multiple languages
- **Code Splitting by Route**: Implement route-based code splitting to reduce initial bundle size and improve load times

### Mobile Optimization

- **Progressive Web App**: Full offline capabilities
- **Responsive Enhancements**: Optimize specific views for mobile usage patterns
- **Touch Gestures**: Implement swipe navigation for mobile users

This design document reflects the current architecture of the ZA Dashboard UI and provides a roadmap for its continued evolution to meet growing requirements and user needs.
